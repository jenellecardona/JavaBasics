What is a constructor:
A constructor is a special block of code that helps us give an initial value to the fields of a class
 Initialization of object or instance.

 Why we should use a constructor
 1.)When we use the constructor to initialize the object it looks more readable and clear
 2.) if the fields of a class are private its not possible to access them outside a class without constructor
 or a method which means we can't initialize them without a method or a constructor
 3.)we can enforce rules like what kind of values are assigned to variables with the help of contructors
 4.)if we want to make sure that some lines of the code should always be executed when the object
  of a class is created we can out that code inside the contractor
  How to use constructors
  we create constructors inside the class and when the object of that class is created the constructor
  is executed automatically


Rules
1.) Constructors don't have return types not even void. (i.e String name(){block of code})
2.) The name of the contractor should always be the same as the name of the class
3.) Constructors can't be created with static keyword
4.) We can use any access modifiers with constructors
5.) If we don't create a constructor in a class a default constructor with zero parameters is created by compiler()
