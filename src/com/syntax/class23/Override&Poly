What is method overriding in java:
When the same method with the same header exist in parent and child class. We will it method overwriting.

Why we should use override a method:
if we inherit from a class all the methods which are not private they are inherited in the child class.
Now if we don't like some of these methods maybe because the consume more internet bandwidth or consume a lot
of CPU or uses a lot of memory we can override them in the child class.

How can we use MethodOverridding:
1. We must first inherit from a class
2. We can redeclare the method with the same header and provide the body of our choice

Example:
clas parent{
void eat(){
System.out.println("I like to eat beef");
}
void sleep(){
System.out.println("I like to sleep 8 hours a day");
}
}
class Child extends Parent{
void eat(){
System.out.println("I like to eat Mutton);
}


Rules:
1. You must have an inheritance relationship(super+base class).
2. Method in the parent and child class must have same headers but they can be different in terms of access modifiers
and in very rare conditions in terms of return type.
3. We can't change the access modifiers from public to protected or default. But we can do it in reverse order.
4. we can't override constructors because they are also not inherited
5. If a methis is static we use a different terminology its called method redeclaration instead of overriding.

Polymorphism



====
final when used with a class meaning no one can inherit that class
final used with a method means no one can override that method
final used with an instance variable means that the value can not be reassigned.
