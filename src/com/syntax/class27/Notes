Collections Framework:
Collections framework is just a collection of interfaces and classes that have many methods to store and manipulate
real life day to day data.

Why We should learn Collections framework:
    Collections framework contains the classes that have pre-built methods to store and
    manipulate the data. These methods are battle tested
    (battle tester=> very well tested something we can use in production environment).
    Production environment =>live environment for public
How can we use the Collections framework:
    They are same classes just like any other class in java. We create the object of the
    class and start calling the methods we just need to take care of the diamond operator.
    we put the name of the class inside the diamond operator <> whos objects we will be
    storing inside these classes for example for Strings and Arraylist the syntax is
    ArrayList<String> objName=new ArrayList<>();
What are wrapper classes:
    They are special classes built to work with collections framework which are replica of
    primitive data types but they are classes means we can use them just like any other class
    we can have methods.
Boxing and unboxing in wrapper classes.
    When we convert a primitive data type like int to a non-primitive wrapper class like
    Integer we call it boxing. This conversion can happen automatically, and we can also call
    explicit methods to convert primitives to non-primitive.
    in the case of auto its called auto boxing and in autoboxing we just assign the data, and it is
    converted automatically while in simple we need to call a method to convert it. Unboxing and auto-Unboxing
    is simple the reverse of it.
Some Downsides not that down:
    1) We need to use the wrapper classes with collections framework.
    2) int num vs integer num Wrapper classes occupy 4 times more memory as compared to
    primitive. but as tester we don't need to worry too much about these wrapper classes.

======================================================================================
List is the first interface that we will be discussing from the collections framework:
List:
1. We can store duplicate data without any issues
2. insertion order maintained [0,1,2,3]
 ArrayList:


List vs array:
List is an interface array is a class that implements that interface






What is an interface:
Its like a blueprint/contract for a class
