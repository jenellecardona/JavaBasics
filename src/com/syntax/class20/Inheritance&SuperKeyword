Inheritance
is a mechanism in java through which one class acquires the properties and methods of another class.
It is one of the main 4 pillars of OOPS

Why we should use inheritance:
1. it helps us reduce the amount of code we have to write
2. it is more efficient
3. saves memory

We can use the extends keyword after the class name then the name of the class from which we want to inherit the code
Example below:

classParent{
String name="Newton";
String eyeColor="brown";
}
class child extends Parent{
System.out.println(name+" "+eyeColor);
}

Types of inheritance
1. Single Inheritance
2. MultiLevel Inheritance
3. Hierarchical Inheritance
4. Multiple Inheritance
5. Hybrid Inheritance
