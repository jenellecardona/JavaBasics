Constructors
is a block of code that is used to construct objects.
Constructors help initialize object in a cleaner more readable way
They are better than methods because they are called automatically when we create an object
Most if the time fields are private and because of this reason we can't access them outside the class in which they
are declared and can't initialize them.

How to use Constructors :
We create the constructor by writing block of code that has same name as class name.
When we create the object of that class it is called automatically


RULES:
1. Constructors don't have return types, even void.
2. constructors should have class name
3. Constructors can have access modifiers like public private protected.
4. Constuctors can't have non access modifiers like static, final, syncronized
5. Default constructor is provided by java if we don't write one.
6. When we create the object of a class then a constructor  is called. For example if the class name is Dog;
Dog dog1=new *Dog();   *is us calling the constructor
7.
8. We can call the constructor of a class by using "this" keyword with parenthesis.
This() We can pass parameters and java will decide based on these parameters which constructors to call.
9. Whenever we have same name variables as instance variable and local variables this keyword can be used to help
us resolve the conflict between local and instance variable.
class human(){
String name="sleeping Zombie";
void(){
String name="wake up zombie";
System.out.println("name);
}
}
